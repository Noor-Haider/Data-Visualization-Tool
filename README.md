# Data Visualization Tool
___
Data Visualization Tool or 'DVT' for short is an application that can generate various graphs based on data from CSV 
(comma-separated values) files. 

The graph can be generated by first loading in the CSV file, setting certain visual
elements, such as the design, title and labels, as well as the graph type and style, and then finally selecting the two
data sets required to generate the graph. The data sets from the file are automatically detected and added to the
drop down options. 

Once the graph has been created, the user has the option to use several graph navigation features such as *zoom* and editing
*figure parameters*. The user can also save the graph as various different file types; such as png, pdf, jpeg, svg and many more.
